# CoolBeans â€” minimal Vite + TypeScript + CRXJS (MV3) extension

This repo contains a minimal scaffold for a Chrome (MV3) extension built with Vite, TypeScript, and @crxjs/vite-plugin.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server (builds extension in-memory):

```
npm run dev
```

3. Load the extension in Chrome/Edge:

- Open chrome://extensions
- Enable Developer mode
- Click "Load unpacked" and select the project root (the plugin will provide a dev build when running `npm run dev`).

Build

```
npm run build
```

Notes

- This is intentionally minimal. Add icons, permissions, and polish as needed.# STORMHACKS-2025-CoolBeans
